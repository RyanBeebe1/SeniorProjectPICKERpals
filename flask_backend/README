right now this is a copy of app.py with a few things added

config file is exactly the same

this is on its own branch of the repo, 'backend'
make sure you commit and push to that branch instead of the master

we'll merch the two branches as we get close to the end, just so we don't 
need to worry about the changes the frontend team makes

since we're all sharing the one logon for this machine, git will credit the 
commits to "Ubuntu"

To get credited for your commits you the following syntax:

git commit --author="gitusername <gitemailaddress>" -m "commit message"
